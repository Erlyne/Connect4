# connect4

## Objective

To be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either vertically, horizontally)

## How to play

Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn.
The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS animaions
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Using neated for loops to make the board dynamically.
- Using query selectors to pick a specific cell that the user clicks.


### Continued development

- I am stiff with css, even though I manage to find a way to make it work somehow, a lot of the times I don't even understand how or why it did work.
- I suck at jQuery and nested loops...
